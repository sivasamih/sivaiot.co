      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in asset tracking involves tagging items with RFID labels or tags. RFID readers capture data from these tags, enabling real-time monitoring of an asset's location and status. This streamlined process, integrated with databases, automates tracking, improves accuracy, and facilitates efficient inventory management in diverse industries."

    "name": "How much information can an RFID tag or label store?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Passive RFID tags are powered by the energy received from the RFID reader and can store limited amounts of data, typically between 96 and 496 bits. The size of the RFID tag also affects the amount of information that can be stored. Smaller tags generally have less memory than larger tags, but new advancements in RFID technology are increasing the amount of data that can be stored on smaller tags making it a useful tool for asset tracking and management."

    "name": "Does an RFID tag read through walls or people?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "RFID tags typically cannot be read through walls or people. RFID technology relies on radio frequency signals for communication between the RFID reader and the tag. Solid objects, including walls and human bodies, can attenuate or block these signals, making it difficult for RFID readers to detect and read tags on the other side. For effective RFID communication, a direct line of sight or proximity between the RFID reader and the tag is generally required."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Cintura Loop-Tag has been developed specifically to tag items that are otherwise difficult to tag such as cables, tubes, ropes, etc. This all-surface tag is well suited for different kinds of surfaces and can also be adjusted to perfectly fit different item diameters. These tags use radio waves to communicate with an RFID reader. They can be attached to cables and can provide real-time identification and tracking of the cables.We proudly have introduced one of our innovation: CylTag™, designed specifically for Beer Kegs, Gas Cylinders and Chemical Drums . Our state-of-the-art RFID tag has been engineered to revolutionize inventory tracking and lifecycle management for businesses dealing with beer kegs and gas canisters suitable for various curvatures of the cylinder."

    "name": "Do RFID tags work in high temperatures?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "The high temperature can affect the performance of the tag's integrated circuit and antenna, potentially leading to reduced read range, communication errors, and even permanent damage. To address these issues, SIVA has developedhigh-temperature RFID tagswhich are specifically designed to operate in harsh environments and withstand temperatures. These tags are made with materials that are resistant to heat and feature a rugged design that helps to protect the internal components. Additionally, they may also have a protective casing or insulation to further enhance their performance in high-temperature conditions."

    "name": "What is the frequency range of RFID tags and labels?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "RFID tags and labels operate within different frequency bands, and the frequency range can vary. The most common RFID frequency bands are Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF), and Ultra High Frequency (UHF). LF typically operates around 125 kHz, HF around 13.56 MHz, and UHF in the range of 860-960 MHz."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "RFID tags used in cold chain temperature monitoring are typically equipped with temperature sensors that can measure and transmit data about the temperature of the products being monitored. These tags do not have a battery and rely on the energy from the reader to transmit data. These tags also have inbuilt moisture sensors that are designed to detect and report moisture levels in their immediate environment."

    "name": "Do dual frequency RFID labels work with metal assets?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Dual frequency RFID labelsare radio frequency identification labels that are equipped with both high-frequency (HF) and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) chips. Yes, dual frequency RFID labels can work with metal assets, although their performance may be affected by the metal's presence. To ensure proper functioning of RFID tags on metal assets, SIVA has developed, a specialized 'on-metal' tag, offered with an EM4425 chip, this versatile RFID labels can be used to secure various types of indoor assets, anti-counterfeiting and product identification. These tags are designed to have a stronger signal and to better withstand the interference caused by metal surfaces."
