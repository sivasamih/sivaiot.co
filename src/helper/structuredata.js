        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "RFID labels typically face challenges when used on metal surfaces due to interference caused by the properties of metal. However, specially designed UHF RFID labels, known as On-metal RFID tags & labels, work effectively on such surfaces.
  
  To overcome the challenges,Mount on Metal RFID labels & tagsincorporate specific design features:
  
  1.Spacer layer / foam material between the tag antenna and the application metal surface.
  
  2.The antenna is specially designed to operate in the presence of a reflective surface. It is tuned to perform optimally when placed on / near metal."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "On-Metal RFID Labels	Regular RFID Labels
  Designed to work on or near metal surfaces	Designed for use on non-metallic surfaces.
  Includes a spacer (e.g., foam, ferrite) to isolate the antenna from metal.	No spacer; antenna is in direct contact with application surface.
  Expensive	Cheaper
  Thickness is more	Slim and light weight
  Application Areas: Manufacturing, Aerospace, Logistics, Healthcare, Automotive etc.	Application Areas: Inventory Management, Supply Chain Tracking, Retail, Logistics, etc."

      "name": "How compatible are On-Metal UHF labels with different readers?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ETSI:865–868 MHz (Europe)
  
  FCC:902–928 MHz (North America)
  
  Global UHF:Some labels are designed to cover the entire range (860–960 MHz).
  
  What needs to be ensured is that the on-metal tag/label and the reader should operate in the same frequency band.
  
  We recommend using Circularly Polarized Antennas as it is great for general use, regardless of tag orientation."

        "text": "RFID Hard Tagsare durable, rugged, and long-lasting identification devices equipped with an RFID chip or antenna. These tags are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making them suitable for use in challenging industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain management."
