            </Typography>
            <Paragraph4>
              Passive RFID tags are powered by the energy received from the RFID
              reader and can store limited amounts of data, typically between 96
              and 496 bits. The size of the RFID tag also affects the amount of
              information that can be stored. Smaller tags generally have less
              memory than larger tags, but new advancements in RFID technology
              are increasing the amount of data that can be stored on smaller
              tags making it a useful tool for asset tracking and management.

              3. Does an RFID tag read through walls or people?
            </Typography>
            <Paragraph4>
              RFID tags typically cannot be read through walls or people. RFID
              technology relies on radio frequency signals for communication
              between the RFID reader and the tag. Solid objects, including
              walls and human bodies, can attenuate or block these signals,
              making it difficult for RFID readers to detect and read tags on
              the other side. For effective RFID communication, a direct line of
              sight or proximity between the RFID reader and the tag is
              generally required.

            </Typography>
            <Paragraph4>
              The high temperature can affect the performance of the tag's
              integrated circuit and antenna, potentially leading to reduced
              read range, communication errors, and even permanent damage. To
              address these issues, SIVA has developed

            <Paragraph4>
              RFID tags and labels operate within different frequency bands, and
              the frequency range can vary. The most common RFID frequency bands
              are Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF), and Ultra High
              Frequency (UHF). LF typically operates around 125 kHz, HF around
              13.56 MHz, and UHF in the range of 860-960 MHz.

              7. What is ETSI and FCC in the context of RFID tags?
            </Typography>
            <Paragraph4>
              ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) and FCC
              (Federal Communications Commission) are regulatory bodies that
              establish standards and regulations for electronic communication
              devices, including RFID tags. ETSI is responsible for setting
              standards in Europe, while the FCC oversees regulations in the
              United States.

              monitoring?
            </Typography>
            <Paragraph4>
              RFID tags used in cold chain temperature monitoring are typically
              equipped with temperature sensors that can measure and transmit
              data about the temperature of the products being monitored. These
              tags do not have a battery and rely on the energy from the reader
              to transmit data. These tags also have inbuilt moisture sensors
              that are designed to detect and report moisture levels in their
              immediate environment.

              both high-frequency (HF) and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) chips.
              Yes, dual frequency RFID labels can work with metal assets,
              although their performance may be affected by the metal's
              presence. To ensure proper functioning of RFID tags on metal
              assets, SIVA has developed, a specialized "on-metal" tag, offered
              with an EM4425 chip, this versatile RFID labels can be used to
              secure various types of indoor assets, anti-counterfeiting and
